      His work launched the global interest in dolphins and whales, provided the
      basis for the movie Day of the Dolphin, and stimulated the enactment of
      the <span id="highlight">Marine Mammal Protection Act</span>. Lilly's interest in the nature of human
      consciousness led him to invent the isolation tank in the 1950s. In the
      early sixties, Lilly encountered LSD and soon took his experiments with
      this mindchanger to the isolation tank. The hairraising experiences that
      resulted formed the essence of the movie Altered States. Lilly's life and
      work at the forefronts of human knowledge encompass the major themes of
      the twentieth century. His dozen books have sold millions of copies
      worldwide. A distinguished brain researcher even before he became a public
      figure, Lilly has sown the seeds of several scientific revolutions,
      including the theory of internal realities, the hardware/software model of
      the human brain/ mind, and the initiation of worldwide efforts at
      interspecies communications with large-brained dolphins.
